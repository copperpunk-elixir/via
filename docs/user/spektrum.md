# Spektrum Transmitter Setup
Unfortunately there is no way to connect your Spektrum transmitter directly to your computer, so you will need to have some additional hardware if you are a Spektrum user. 

## USB Dongle (Linux only!)
The easier but more expensive option is to use the [Spektrum Wireless Simulator USB Dongle](https://www.spektrumrc.com/Products/Default.aspx?ProdID=SPMWS2000). This will make your transmitter act just like a joystick. Unfortunately this thing is $45, so be sure you're running Linux before you buy!. <p align="center"><img src="../resources/spektrum_usb.jpg" width="40%"></p>

## USB to Serial Converter
If you don't mind a little bit of soldering, and you already have a Spektrum receiver, there is a cheaper method. And that documentation will be coming soon.
