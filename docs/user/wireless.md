# Wireless Network (simulation only)

When using a Raspberry Pi for simulation, it is possible to connect to your host computer network wirelessly (as opposed to using an Ethernet cable). In order to join the network, as described [here](modifying_configurations.md).

> Wireless networking is not recommended with the RealFlight simulator, but should perform adequately with X-Plane. If you experience odd behavior (sluggish vehicle control), it is suggested you switch to a Ethernet connection. In order to switch from wireless back to Ethernet, you must provide a `network.txt` that is blank. This will override the saved network credentials.
