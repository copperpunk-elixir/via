# Via

Welcome! You are looking at the open source version of an Elixir-based autopilot that was developed by COPPERPUNK. The only difference between this and the other version is that hopefully this one is better. In order to make that the case, we started over. This means the documentation is basically non-existent and the features are fewer (for now). If you would like to read about the older version (code name `Gristle`), you can check out our blog : https://www.copperpunk.com/blog/categories/gristle.

If you are reading this, then you're probably already aware of what Via is all about. At some point there will actually be words to describe it, but right now we're just working on making a version of the software available to the public. Stay tuned.

## Simulation
Via integrates with X-Plane in order to create a software-in-the-loop (SIL) testing environment. Instructions on how to run Via in conjunction with X-Plane can be found [here](docs/user/xplane_sim.md).
Integration with RealFlight will follow soon.
## Hardware
Via is currently testable with software only. The code exists for putting it on representative hardware, but we have not developed the tools for connecting the hardware back to the simulator (as was done with Gristle). This is high on the priority list.

## Questions/Comments
If you have any issues with running the simuation, please file an issue. If you have any general comments or questions, or simply would like to chat about the autopilot, please head over the www.copperpunk.com. There you can sign up for some open source office hours, or just leave a quick message. Thanks!
