Welcome! You are looking at the open source version of an Elixir-based autopilot that is being developed by COPPERPUNK. The only difference between this and the previous version is that hopefully this one is better. In order to make that the case, we started over. This means the documentation is basically non-existent and the features are fewer (for now). If you would like to read about the older version (code name `Gristle`), you can check out our blog : https://www.copperpunk.com/blog/categories/gristle.

Via is not ready for developer collaboration just yet. Things are still changing quite a bit, so we wouldn't want anyone to waste their time writing code that will be obsolete in a week. However, we would love for people to start using the software. [This post](https://www.copperpunk.com/post/introducing-via) outlines a few reasons why Via might be worth your time.

## Hardware
In order to bypass the difficulties associated with supporting multiple operating systems, Via is built to run on a Raspberry Pi 3. This allows anyone to download a firmware image and run Via on their Pi without having to modify their host system. Development will be supported for the Linux environment, but we'll cross that bridge at a later date.

## Simulation
Via integrates with X-Plane in order to create a software-in-the-loop (SIL) testing environment. Instructions on how to run Via in conjunction with X-Plane can be found [here](docs/user/xplane_sim.md).
Integration with RealFlight will follow soon.<br>

## Questions/Comments
If you have any issues with running the simuation, please file an issue. If you have any general comments or questions, or simply would like to chat about the autopilot, please head over the www.copperpunk.com. There you can sign up for some open source office hours, or just leave a quick message. Thanks!
